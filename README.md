<b> Course Curriculum: Java OOP </b>

**<ins>Working with Abstraction</ins>**: In the Working with Abstraction module, I delved into the concept of abstraction. I learned how to abstract away complex details and create more manageable code. This included understanding abstract classes and methods, allowing me to implement abstraction effectively in Java.

**<ins>Encapsulation</ins>**: In the Encapsulation module, I focused on encapsulating data and methods within classes in Java. I learned how to keep class fields private and control access through public methods, ensuring data integrity and promoting better code structure. This concept is key for creating secure and maintainable software.

**<ins>Inheritance</ins>**: In the Inheritance module, I delved into the powerful concept of building relationships between classes in Java. This involved creating new classes that inherit attributes and behaviors from existing ones, fostering a streamlined and hierarchical code structure. By inheriting from a base class, I honed the skill of reusing code intelligently, thereby enhancing both development efficiency and code maintainability.

**<ins>Interfaces and Abstraction</ins>**: Within the Interfaces and Abstraction module, I focused on two pivotal concepts in Java that contribute to creating modular and flexible code structures. Through abstraction, I learned to create abstract classes with method signatures, leaving the implementation details to the derived classes. By implementing interfaces, I gained the ability to achieve multiple inheritances, allowing a class to inherit from more than one source.

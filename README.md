<b> Course Curriculum: Java OOP </b>

**<ins>Working with Abstraction</ins>**: In the Working with Abstraction module, I delved into the concept of abstraction. I learned how to abstract away complex details and create more manageable code. This included understanding abstract classes and methods, allowing me to implement abstraction effectively in Java.

**<ins>Encapsulation</ins>**: In the Encapsulation module, I focused on encapsulating data and methods within classes in Java. I learned how to keep class fields private and control access through public methods, ensuring data integrity and promoting better code structure. This concept is key for creating secure and maintainable software.
